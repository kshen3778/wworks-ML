We've got a billion bubbles for you to classify. Would you enjoy working with teachers to improve the user experience? Fantastic, we've got hundreds at your disposal.\r\n",
      "* Your work will really matter. Unlike larger companies which need someone working full-time on every nook and cranny of the administrative interface to their advertising platform, the software you're working on will be used directly by hundreds of teachers a day.\n",
