      "As an intern here at Coursera, you will have the mentorship, environment, and the responsibility of deploying your projects to production. We don't throw away intern projects after you leave!\n",
      "Coursera's mission is to transform lives by providing access to the world's best education. Our engineering team uses a modern tech stack, building all of Coursera on top of AWS. Our website uses React and Webpack written all in ES6, we use Swift for iOS and Java for Android and our backend is built in Scala using MySQL and Cassandra as a datastore. We are looking for rising sophomores and juniors for our spring, summer and winter internship programs. We typically have a dozen interns each program. The programs are highly competitive, so apply as soon as you know you are available. The context team is looking for their next intern! Coursera offers opportunities for learners everywhere, including those who are part of organizations (companies, NGOs, refugee centers). The Context team is building out an experience for such learners (and corresponding organization admins) to up-skill themselves through free access to a number of Coursera courses. This relatively new product, with a massive revenue upside, has a lot of interesting projects lined up around social learning, gamification and analytics.\n",
