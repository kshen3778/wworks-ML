      "Solace is looking for a Coop Student, Software Test Engineer to develop software to validate our message routers and APIs. Solace is the world leader in high-performance hardware-based message routing. Message routing allows application layer messages to be routed through a wide area network based on a topic that is distributed as part of the message itself. Message routers differ significantly from the IP routers of today. IP routers route based on fixed-sized addresses attached to all incoming messages. Message routers look at a variable-sized 'topic' to determine which end nodes are interested in it and then route the message accordingly. Message routing has existed for some time and forms the basis of much of the communications in finance, government, and cloud computing. However, a revolution is underway. The current message routing networks are based solely on generic servers running customized software. Message rates are increasing exponentially and these software-based systems are starting to buckle under the pressure. Solace is the first company to move the core message routing processing into our own purposefully-built and patented hardware. This has resulted in performance increases 10 to 100 times greater than legacy software solutions. And the world is taking notice. Hardware changed that space forever and resulted in incredible success stories for early hardware vendors. Message routing is at that turning point today. Solace is an industry leader advancing the charge, providing hardware, software, and cloud based solutions for a wide variety of deployments, including the flexibility of hybrid infrastructures. Our customers include industry bellwethers such as Barclays Capital, British Telecom, and SoftBank Telecom. Our technology is revolutionary. Our team is world class.

This means building things that have never been built before: you'll need to quickly learn new concepts and apply them to your work. We value speed, but we value stability more. We write tools that are used to secure the largest web applications in the world. If you've ever watched a video or streamed music online, your data has probably been secured by code we've written. To date, our software has found and fixed over 1.4 million security vulnerabilities in the web. You'll be in charge of a large project, in a domain of your choosing. This might involve anything from distributed systems to static analysis or information architecture. Previous interns have designed and implemented dashboards for visualizing vulnerability data, and built tooling for analyzing SSL / TLS configurations for security vulnerabilities. We have a lot of ideas for interesting projects, but we want people with their own ideas too. We'll work together to find a project that excites you. Our software stack is primarily Elixir, Ruby, and Go, but we're advocates of choosing the best tool for the job. If something like Elm is going to help you solve a problem more effectively then we want you to convince us of that.\n",

Using the same techniques as malicious hackers, we systematically test all the access points. As we find vulnerabilities we'll stick them right back in front of your developers, either in a simple checklist format or by integrating into the issue tracker of your choice, instantly notifying you when there's a threat and giving you step-by-step instructions, tailored to your software stack, to eliminate it. We're not limited by technologies or stacks you pick. Be it a website or API driven mobile app or IoT device, we can secure it. You have a lot to manage; let us manage your security.\n",
