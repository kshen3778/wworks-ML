The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is generating huge amounts of data from sensors in industrial devices. Combined with the advent of indefinite computing power available on demand in the cloud and machine learning techniques, industrial value chains will be fundamentally disrupted by software, and data will emerge as the world's most valuable resource. Cognite. Cognite AS (\"Cognite\"), is a technology start-up company, with the ambition to develop and commercialize a state-of-the-art industrial data platform. The platform that Cognite is developing empowers customers to collect and analyze all this industrial data real-time. The name Cognite comes from our ambition of building the world's best industrial brain, with the ability to ingest and process industrial data using cognitive computing. Data are like signals to a human brain. Cognite technology can both react instantly, as well as learn over time. This will enable unified, scalable, and secure access to data for internal and external experts who can deploy state-of-the-art algorithms to solve business critical problems. The platform typically deals with time series with a single value per time, like pressure, temperature, but also sound and video. The data needs to be ingested, stored, processed and made available for analysis and machine learning. We enrich the data with contextual data about the equipment, ERP data, logs and 3D models. The platform has to be fast (low latency) and highly scalable. A single ship can contain several thousand sensors and a drilling rig 50 - 100 thousand sensors. The amount of such data produced will increase rapidly going forward, but it needs to be ?refined? to have value. Predictive maintenance, more efficient equipment load and complete operations overview are examples of use-cases of this technology. Who is using Cognite. Our main customer today is Aker BP, with whom we have entered into a long-term strategic partnership. On the back of this and our solid funding, we are targeting to grow quickly to a global market across industries. Team.
