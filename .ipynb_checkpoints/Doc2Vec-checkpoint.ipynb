At Pitstop we are developing a software platform that aggregates data and uses machine learning to perform predictive maintenance for vehicles. Today the process of maintaining our vehicles is time consuming and expensive. One reason for this is because information is fragmented amongst Service Centers, OEMs and online databases. Pitstop aggregates data from key partners to drive predictive insights on component failures including the emission control system, powertrain issues (spark, fuel, air­flow), vehicle recalls and recurring maintenance issues. Working at a startup means working on a lot of different problems. Here is a sample of the type of problems we're working on: - Machine Learning: Classifying vehicle failures based on different criteria - Data Mining, Information Retrieval: Mining online content to identify vehicle problems and fixes - Web Development, Infrastructure: Building scalable, highly available, fault tolerant systems - Native Application Development: iOS and Android We are looking for an Android Developer with strong UI/UX skills who possesses a passion for pushing mobile technologies to the limits and will work with us to design and build the next generation of our mobile application\n",
